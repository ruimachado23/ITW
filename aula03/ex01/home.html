            <h1 class="title">WHAT IS LEAGUE OF LEGENDS?</h1>
            <p class="text">"League of Legends", or LoL, has been the most played game in the world since 2012. Riot Games has held control over the online gaming scene for over half a decade. If you identify as a gamer, then you have definitely heard of LoL. League of Legends is a complicated game that has a steep learning curve, but with knowledge comes power.League of Legends is often categorized as a MOBA, or multiplayer online battle arena, but League has a lot of different genre elements. MOBAs typically have RTS, or real-time strategy, components throughout the game. In a nutshell, League of Legends can be described as a MOBA that has two teams, five players each, fight against each other with an objective in mind. MOBAs, like League of Legends, often require more dexterity and strategy than lightning-fast trigger finger reactions.

            <h1 class="title">HOW DO I PLAY LEAGUE OF LEAGENDS?</h1>
            <pclass="text">League of Legends is one of the most in-depth games out there to play and isn’t known for its shallow learning curve. It is a frustrating and unforgiving game but can be very rewarding at the same time. Organizing strategies and becoming familiar with each champion are all daunting tasks. Over time players will be pulling off new strategies and falling into the norm, while the skill gap continues to excel. LoL is an ever-changing game and that is one of the main reasons it remains at the top.

            <h1 class="title"> WHAT IS THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME?</h1>
            <p class="text">One of the main goals is to destroy enemy structures like turrets. Turrets can deal a lot of damage, and if there are no other minions around, the turret will deal that damage towards that one champion if they remain in turret range. Players that attack an enemy champion under an enemy turret will become the new target for that turret, as long as no other ally champion has ‘turret aggro’. When attacking a turret, champions need as many minions attacking as possible. If a team destroys an enemy’s inhibitor, it will grant a super minion for five minutes.
